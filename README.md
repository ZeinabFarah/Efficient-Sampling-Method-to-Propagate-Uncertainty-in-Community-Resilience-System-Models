## Efficient Sampling Method for Community Resilience System Models
This repository contains code for an efficient **Importance Sampling** method to propagate uncertainty in community resilience system models, along with an overleaf manuscript detailing the method and its application.  

### Codes  
The code folder includes two subfolders:  

1. *Illustrative Example*  
This folder contains code for an illustrative example that compares the efficiency of Importance Sampling and crude Monte Carlo in a hypothetical example.    

2. *Reliability of WSN*  
This folder contains code for determining the reliability of a hypothetical Water Supply Network (WSN) using Importance Sampling and crude Monte Carlo.    

### Overleaf Manuscript
This folder contains the manuscript detailing the efficient Importance Sampling method and its application to community resilience system models, specifically focusing on water supply systems. The manuscript includes theoretical background, implementation details, and examples of the method in action.

## Getting Started
